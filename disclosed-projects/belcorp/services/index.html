                <li>A comprehensive site survey service, reflected in a number of revised documents and drawings Including the recommended fitting of an RFID tag per critical equipment item, in support of a robust Asset Management System, if not already in existence.</li>
                <li>A comprehensive safety audit service, to confirm suitability of certified equipment located in classified hazardous areas .Given that not every site modification is guaranteed to be reflected in every safety-related document and drawing, and prior to implementation</li>
                <li>Test & calibration service Our new PH warehousing facility has a workshop which caters for instrumentation; it will later include both mechanical and electrical test and calibration support services.</li>
                <li>A low cost, high quality, asset management system package. This is for small to medium sized production facilities, be they offshore or onshore. Equipment performance history can be viewed 24/7 and, together with breakdown preventive, predictive maintenance work programs will reduce the facility’s overall operational expenditure (OPEX), thereby lowering its net life-cycle-cost which is the primary goal of each of our projects.</li>

        <div class="container">
            <h2>Access Management</h2>
            <div class="sec-1">
                <p>Asset Management is all about making your facility perform better, by either increasing production through debottlenecking [the operations approach] or by reducing OPEX overheads [the maintenance approach].</p>
                <p>Both approaches contributev to increasing profits, which is THE primary justification for an AMS.</p>
                <p>A modern Oil, Gas or Energy related asset management system interfaces knowledge-base tools, like active RFIDs and 3D surveys, with software solutions that can take full control of a facility’s maintenance organization.</p>
                <p>To efficiently support its strategic maintenance plan, every production facility must have available all necessary information (as-built and as-operating knowledge) of which the below four sources – taken together – will help guarantee the greatest life cycle return on its asset management investment:</p>
            </div>

            <div class="sec-2">
                <h3>1. RFID tag related data</h3>
                <p>A good AMS must have robust, corrosion resistant, physical equipment tags.</p>
                <p>Does every equipment item on your facility have an accessible and clearly legible physical label/nameplate, from which you can get CRITICAL MANUFACTURER DATA (model and serial numbers, wetted part materials, size and rating, range/setting)? Are such labels/nameplates likely to last the remaining lifetime of your facility? If in doubt, fit a cheap RFID tag as part of an AMS upgrade, then no more lifetime tagging problems!</p>
                <p>A Radio Frequency Identification tag stores digital information on a microchip which can be read remotely which can be read remotely (without physical contact) in a far shorter time and from a much safer position. Unlike traditional equipment labels/nameplates, these tags are RESISTANT to chemical/water attacks and environmental extremes, hence an RFID tag is the ideal physical tagging device in which to store Critical Manufacturer Data, which will last as long as the life of the production facility itself.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="sec-3">
                <h3>2. Three dimensional data</h3>
                <p>A 3D model reduces OPEX brownfield project costs  over the facility’s <strong>LIFETIME</strong></p>
                <p>2D drawings traditionally provide epic details of as-installed and as-operating plant equipment. But when it comes to a brownfield mod(caused, amongst other reasons, from poor original design), a 2D-based project costs more and takes longer than its 3D-based modern day alternative. Now, every major OGE project has its design detail validated using a 3D model for it is so much better/more economic/most lifetime useful, than any 2D proposal!</p>
                <p>A 3D model using a laser scanner guarantees an accurate perspective, especially when destruct work has to be done (first) before any construct work must take place (second), in order to complete the scope of a brownfield modification, say to  debottleneck a specific product limitation. As a consequence, clashes are eliminated before site work starts, materials are more accurately quantified, and “safety walkthroughs” guarantee efficient emergency egress!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="sec-4">
                <h3>3. Pareto faults data</h3>
                <p>Every plan must be based on what faults are “likely” to occur and when else it’s not much use. Do you know and for EVERY TYPE of equipment item(be it simple or complex), the 20% faults that cause 80% of your problems are most likely and most frequent ones known as “Pareto” faults.</p>
                <p>For strategic maintenance planning, a baseline set of Pareto faults should be provided by the manufacturer (in maintenance manual) then revised to reflect real time insitu performance.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="sec-5">
                <h3>4. Operational performance data</h3>
                <p>Measurement, analysis and testing is the route to controlling (and improving) daily performance If we can't measure it, then we can’t analyze it, if we can't test it (check its performance) then we certainly won't be able to improve it for sure. Scalable SMP software , designed with achieving performance enhancements in mind and which can be customized to suit any OGE production facility, GUARANTEES asset management improvements, and throughout a facility’s lifetime!</p>
